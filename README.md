## Introduction

This repository contains a comprehensive example of how to perform text classification in Python. The project walks through the entire process from raw text data to a trained machine learning model, providing a hands-on approach to learning text classification.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidesidoti/text_classification
cd text-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the text classification:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the text data.
2. **Feature Extraction:** Convert text data into numerical features using methods like TF-IDF.
3. **Model Training:** Train a machine learning model using scikit-learn.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

Run the example script to see the process in action:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Techniques for cleaning and preparing text data.
- **Feature Extraction:** Methods for converting text into numerical features.
- **Model Training:** Using popular algorithms for text classification.
- **Evaluation:** Metrics and methods for assessing model performance.
